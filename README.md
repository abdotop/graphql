# GraphQL

You will have to create a profile UI where you can see your own school information. This information/data is present on the GraphQL endpoint, where you will have to query it.

The UI design is up to you. However, it must have a statistic section where you can generate graphs to see more about your journey and achievements on the school. This graphs must be done using SVG. You need to do at least two different statistic graphs for the data given. Bare in mind the principles of a good UI.

Using SVG you can create several types of graphs including interactive graphs and animated graph. It will be up to you to decide what type of graphs you are going to do.

Here are some possible combinations for the creation of the graphs:

XP earned in a time period (progress over time)
XP earned by project
Audit ratio
Projects PASS and FAIL ratio
Piscine (JS/Go) stats
PASS and FAIL ratio
Attempts for each exercise
Any other information you desire to display is welcome and will be noted.
